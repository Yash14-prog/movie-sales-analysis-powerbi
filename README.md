# Movie Sales Analysis | Power BI Project

## Project Overview

The movie industry releases thousands of movies every year across different genres, budgets, and durations. However, not all movies achieve box office success. Production houses and distributors often struggle to understand which factors drive higher revenue.

This project analyzes historical movie sales data to uncover patterns related to **revenue, genre, ratings, runtime, and audience engagement**. An interactive **Power BI dashboard** is built to support **data-driven decision-making** in the movie industry.

## Business Problem

* Why do some movies generate high revenue while others fail?
* Which genres consistently perform better at the box office?
* Does a higher IMDb rating guarantee higher revenue?

* How does audience popularity (votes) impact box office performance?

---

## Objectives

* Analyze box office revenue trends over time
* Identify top-performing genres, movies, and directors
* Study the relationship between **IMDb rating, votes, runtime, and revenue**
* Understand audience preferences and genre popularity
* Identify optimal movie runtime for better performance
* Build an interactive **Power BI dashboard** for insights

## Key Insights

* **Action** is the highest revenue-generating genre
* Movie releases and total revenue have increased over the years
* **Medium-length movies (90–120 minutes)** perform best in both revenue and ratings
* Higher IMDb ratings generally support higher revenue, but ratings alone do not guarantee success
* Movies with higher audience votes earn more revenue, showing strong popularity impact
* A small number of top movies and directors contribute a major share of total revenue

## Conclusion

This analysis shows that movie success depends on multiple factors such as **genre, popularity, runtime, and ratings**. While high ratings help, audience engagement and genre selection play a crucial role in revenue generation. The interactive Power BI dashboard provides valuable insights that can help production houses make informed, data-driven decisions.
